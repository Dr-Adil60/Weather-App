## ***Weather App***
This is a simple weather app that fetches real-time weather data and displays it with clean, responsive styling. The app uses a free API to fetch weather information and allows users to check the current weather by entering a city name.

## ***Features:***

Displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Clean and responsive design suitable for mobile and desktop devices.

## ***Setup Instructions***

To run this app, you'll need:

A web browser (for front-end display).
A text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.) to modify the code if needed.

Once signed in, go to the API section and get your unique API key.
Note: The free API plan has a limit of calls per day, so don't forget to use your own API key.

**Update the API Key:**

In the project files, locate the section where the API key is used.
Replace the existing API key with your newly generated key.

Install Dependencies (if any): If your project uses external libraries (e.g., axios, jQuery, etc.), make sure to install them using npm or include the appropriate <script> tags.

bash
Copy code
npm install
Or you can simply include the required scripts directly in your HTML file.

Run the App:

Open the project folder in your code editor.
Open the index.html file in your browser to see the app in action.
Alternatively, you can use any local development server to run the app.

## ***Usage Instructions***
Enter a city name in the input field and click on the "Get Weather" button.
The app will display the current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.


## ***Customization***
You can customize the look and feel of the app by modifying the styles.css file. The app's layout is designed to be responsive, so it should work well on both mobile and desktop screens.

## ***Notes***
The free API plan from OpenWeatherMap has a limit on the number of requests you can make per day, so don't forget to create your own API key if you run out of calls.
You are free to use other free weather APIs if you prefer.
